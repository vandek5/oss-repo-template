# Lab 04 - Licensing

### Why have a license?

It's important to choose a license because by default
intellectual property is All Rights Reserved. This
obviously doesn't mesh with open source.
Additionally, choosing a license forces consideration
of how you want others using your work.


### Why not use unlicensed projects?

As stated above, unlicensed intellectual property defaults
to All Rights Reserved. However, there may exist some sort
of implied covenant by allowing the distribution, but even
still it is better to not risk legal issues.

### Web v. Gopher

The article posits that Gopher failed to follow the open
system model, and this is at least partly why it lost to the
Web. Overall, I agree with this assertion. By not being open
and available to would-be hackers, these people were turned
off of Gopher, and as a result contributed little to Gopher's
momentum. In contrast, the Web was quickly modified and
improved by communities of these people and thus gained more
momentum and users.

### Linux & GPLv2

Founded with open source at its heart, Linux is currently
distributed under the GPLv2 license. To the maintainers, the
freedoms allowed by truly free software was paramount. GPLv2
is a license that explicitly allows these freedoms, but
crucially, adds a condition that derivatives must also be
similarly licensed. This is in-line with the maintainers'
ideals - that improvements be shared with the community.
