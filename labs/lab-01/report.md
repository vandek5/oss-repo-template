## Free Culture

I learned that the RIAA, like many similar litigious and for-profit organizations,
abuse the US court system to extract vast quantities of money from private individuals
in a somehow still legal extortion scheme. Thus, it is prudent to be aware of legal
implications in all of our work, as we cannot rely on the technically inept boomer
lawyers to understand literally anything about open source software. This awareness
includes, but is not limited to, carefully observing licenses on all work that even
potentially come into contact with ours, staying far away from infringing material,
and being aware of our ability to unionize into a general strike and revolution that
dismantles the unjust capitalist system of the United States and even the world.

## Reflection

Well, as a coordinator of RCOS I'm quite in tune with locally grown, organic,
grassroots open source projects. I fully intend to observe all of our projects
from their inception through this semester :) . 

?? Kind of a weird instruction... "Add a paragraph on how you are doing this activity"
the activity itself is pretty....... open-ended? Probably the nicest way to put that.
Wherein the 'activity' is to 'start thinking about a project that is interesting'.
Unless I've completely misinterpreted the assignment. Idk. My brain doesn't tend to
work the same as others so idk lol

Let me know if I can improve this answer. (Open an issue on my repository)
